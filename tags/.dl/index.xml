Today, the vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed from mammograms. While radiologists are skilled in identifying suspicious areas once cancer is already visible on the image, they have limited capacity in predicting which patients are heading towards cancer diagnosis before mass is formed.

Substantial research in medical literature confirms that certain changes in the breast tissue are early precursors of cancer development.</description>
