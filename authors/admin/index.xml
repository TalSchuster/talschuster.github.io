      <title>Deep Learning Model to Assess Cancer Risk on the Basis of a Breast MR Image Alone</title>

      <description>Our DL model can assess the 5-year cancer risk on the basis of a breast MR image alone, and it showed improved individual risk discrimination when compared with a state-of-the-art risk assessment model. These results offer promising preliminary data regarding the potential of image-based risk assessment models to support more personalized care.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Ph.D. student at MIT CSAIL and a member of the NLP and Learn To Cure groups. My advisor is Prof. Regina Barzilay.  Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m focusing on automatic fact-checking and on the geometry of contextual word embeddings. I have also worked on creating deep learning screening-based methods to improve cancer detection and risk assessment.  Before coming to MIT, I was an MSc student in Computer Science at Tel Aviv University, advised by Prof.</description>
