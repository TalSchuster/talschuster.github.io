      <title>Deep Learning Model to Assess Cancer Risk on the Basis of a Breast MR Image Alone</title>

      <description>Our DL model can assess the 5-year cancer risk on the basis of a breast MR image alone, and it showed improved individual risk discrimination when compared with a state-of-the-art risk assessment model. These results offer promising preliminary data regarding the potential of image-based risk assessment models to support more personalized care.</description>
