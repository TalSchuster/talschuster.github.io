We show, however, that in the popular FEVER dataset this might not necessarily be the case. Claim-only classifiers perform competitively with top evidence-aware models. In this paper, we investigate the cause of this phenomenon, identifying strong cues for predicting labels solely based on the claim, without considering any evidence. We create an evaluation set that avoids those idiosyncrasies. The performance of FEVER-trained models significantly drops when evaluated on this test set. Therefore, we introduce a regularization method which alleviates the effect of bias in the training data, obtaining improvements on the newly created test set. This work is a step towards a more sound evaluation of reasoning capabilities in fact verification models.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Debiasing Fact Verification Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam Yala","Tal Schuster","Randy Miles","Regina Barzilay","Constance Lehman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565049600,"objectID":"8a1f8e1a10a54491fee218ea25bc0648","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tals/publication/mammo_triage/","publishdate":"2019-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tals/publication/mammo_triage/","section":"publication","summary":"A DL model to triage a portion of mammograms as cancer free, improving performance and workflow efficiency.","tags":["Deep Learning","Mammography"],"title":"A Deep Learning Mammography-based Model for Improved Breast Cancer Risk Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tal Schuster","Ori Ram","Regina Barzilay","Amir Globerson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559606400,"objectID":"b789082fe47680b66c480a0fe4fff944","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tals/publication/crosslingual_elmo/","publishdate":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tals/publication/crosslingual_elmo/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a novel method for multilingual transfer that utilizes deep contextual embeddings, pretrained in an unsupervised fashion. While contextual embeddings have been shown to yield richer representations of meaning compared to their static counterparts, aligning them poses a challenge due to their dynamic nature. To this end, we construct context-independent variants of the original monolingual spaces and utilize their mapping to derive an alignment for the context-dependent spaces. This mapping readily supports processing of a target language, improving transfer by context-aware embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for zero-shot and few-shot learning of dependency parsing. Specifically, our method consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on 6 target languages, yielding an improvement of 6.8 LAS points on average.","tags":null,"title":"Cross-Lingual Alignment of Contextual Word Embeddings, with Applications to Zero-shot Dependency Parsing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam Yala","Constance Lehman","Tal Schuster","Tally Portnoi","Regina Barzilay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557187200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557187200,"objectID":"d3c2c6a0b463ad2965d2743a2e7f43c0","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tals/publication/mammo_risk/","publishdate":"2019-05-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tals/publication/mammo_risk/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model.","tags":["Deep Learning","Mammography"],"title":"A Deep Learning Mammography-based Model for Improved Breast Cancer Risk Prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tally Portnoi","Adam Yala","Tal Schuster","Regina Barzilay","Brian Dontchos","Leslie Lamb","Constance Lehman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546819200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546819200,"objectID":"80a02bbc76309c194b5fe75a0fb0738c","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tals/publication/mri/","publishdate":"2019-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tals/publication/mri/","section":"publication","summary":"Our DL model can assess the 5-year cancer risk on the basis of a breast MR image alone, and it showed improved individual risk discrimination when compared with a state-of-the-art risk assessment model.

While radiologists are skilled in identifying suspicious areas once cancer is already visible on the image, they have limited capacity in predicting which patients are heading towards cancer diagnosis before mass is formed. Reliably identifying such patients is the crucial first step in preventing cancer development. Substantial research in medical literature confirms that certain changes in the breast tissue are early precursors of cancer development. However, patterns identified by humans are not sufficiently strong to act upon them.\nWe are aiming to automate these predictions by developing deep learning algorithms that can using longitudinal imaging data with known outcomes. By reading millions of images (orders of magnitude more than humans can read in their lifetime), machines should be able to assess the likelihood of cancer occurrence in a more accurate fashion. We are currently collecting a large corpus that will enable us to answer this question. Meanwhile, we are building algorithms that can help radiologists with their daily tasks of mammogram reading. The deep learning models we developed today can accurately predict breast density and identify with human accuracy a large fraction of safe screening mammograms.\n","date":1506297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506297600,"objectID":"e2ab62a05f4c5180aabbef46764a1a03","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tals/project/mammography/","publishdate":"2017-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tals/project/mammography/","section":"project","summary":"Deep learning models to improve cancer risk assessment.","tags":["Medical","Deep Learning","Vision"],"title":"Medical","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Analyzing the space of word represenations for multilingual applications and for better performance with less data.\n","date":1506297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506297600,"objectID":"049a11ddb4792fa0a6e07d7ec7e9ee03","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tals/project/embeddings/","publishdate":"2017-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tals/project/embeddings/","section":"project","summary":"Dense representations of words for NLP.","tags":["Embeddings","NLP","Deep Learning"],"title":"Word Embeddings","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tal Schuster","Lior Wolf","David Gadot"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498867200,"objectID":"7a4eb34ff58bbdaa22125d4bc053783e","permalink":"http://people.csail.mit.edu/tals/publication/optical/","publishdate":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tals/publication/optical/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that the matching problem that underlies optical flow requires multiple strategies, depending on the amount of image motion and other factors.
