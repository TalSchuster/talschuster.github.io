To date, there seems to be still no consensus on what the right architecture and pre-training setup should be. This paper presents a unified framework for pre-training models that are universally effective across datasets and setups. We begin by disentangling architectural archetypes with pre-training objectives -- two concepts that are commonly conflated. Next, we present a generalized \u0026 unified perspective for self-supervision in NLP and show how different pre-training objectives can be cast as one another and how interpolating between different objectives can be effective. We then propose Mixture-of-Denoisers (MoD), a pre-training objective that combines diverse pre-training paradigms together. We furthermore introduce a notion of mode switching, wherein downstream fine-tuning is associated with specific pre-training schemes. We conduct extensive ablative experiments to compare multiple pre-training objectives and find that our method pushes the Pareto-frontier by outperforming T5 \u0026 GPT-like models across multiple diverse setups. By scaling our model up to 20B parameters, we achieve SOTA performance on 50 well-established supervised finetuning based NLP tasks. Our model also achieve strong results at in-context learning, outperforming 175B GPT-3 on zero-shot SuperGLUE and tripling the performance of T5-XXL on one-shot summarization. On 0-shot MMLU, UL2 20B outperforms T0 and T5 models. UL2 20B also works well with chain-of-thought prompting and reasoning, making it an appealing choice for research into reasoning at a small to medium scale of 20B parameters. Finally, we apply FLAN instruction tuning to the UL2 20B model, achieving MMLU and Big-Bench scores competitive to FLAN-PaLM 62B. We release Flax-based T5X checkpoints for the UL2 20B \u0026 Flan-UL2 20B.","tags":[""],"title":"UL2: Unifying Language Learning Paradigms","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tal Schuster","Adam Fisch","Jai Gupta","Mostafa Dehghani","Dara Bahri","Vinh Q.

While certain predictions truly benefit from the models' full capacity, other continuations are more trivial and can be solved with reduced compute. In this work, we introduce Confident Adaptive Language Modeling (CALM), a framework for dynamically allocating different amounts of compute per input and generation timestep. Early exit decoding involves several challenges that we address here, such as: (1) what confidence measure to use; (2) connecting sequence-level constraints to local per-token exit decisions; and (3) attending back to missing hidden representations due to early exits in previous tokens.

This leads to a coverage limitation that results in underestimating the true performance of systems, and is typically addressed by extending over exact match (EM) with predefined rules or with the token-level F1 measure. In this paper, we present the first systematic conceptual and data-driven analysis to examine the shortcomings of token-level equivalence measures. To this end, we define the asymmetric notion of answer equivalence (AE), accepting answers that are equivalent to or improve over the reference, and collect over 26K human judgements for candidates produced by multiple QA systems on SQuAD. Through a careful analysis of this data, we reveal and quantify several concrete limitations of the F1 measure, such as false impression of graduality, missing dependence on question, and more. Since collecting AE annotations for each evaluated model is expensive, we learn a BERT matching BEM measure to approximate this task. Being a simpler task than QA, we find BEM to provide significantly better AE approximations than F1, and more accurately reflect the performance of systems. Finally, we also demonstrate the practical utility of AE and BEM on the concrete application of minimal accurate prediction sets, reducing the number of required answers by up to 2.6 times.","tags":[""],"title":"Tomayto, Tomahto.

Standard conformal prediction provides the ability to adapt to model uncertainty by constructing a calibrated candidate set in place of a single prediction, with guarantees that the set contains the correct answer with high probability. In order to obey this coverage property, however, conformal sets can become inundated with noisy candidatesâ€”which can render them unhelpful in practice. This is particularly relevant to practical applications where there is a limited budget, and the cost (monetary or otherwise) associated with false positives is non-negligible. We propose to trade coverage for a notion of precision by enforcing that the presence of incorrect candidates in the predicted conformal sets (i.e., the total number of false positives) is bounded according to a user-specified tolerance. Subject to this constraint, our algorithm then optimizes for a generalized notion of set coverage (i.e., the true positive rate) that allows for any number of true answers for a given query (including zero). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across a number of classification tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and computational chemistry.","tags":[""],"title":"Conformal Prediction Sets with Limited False Positives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vamsi Aribandi","Yi Tay","Tal Schuster","Jinfeng Rao","Huaixiu Steven Zheng","Sanket Vaibhav Mehta","Honglei Zhuang","Vinh Q Tran","Dara Bahri","Jianmo Ni","Jai Gupta","Kai Hui","Sebastian Ruder","Donald Metzler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"242c2ba54b0ccb5774e864d329d08ede","permalink":"https://talschuster.github.io/publication/ext5/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ext5/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the recent success of multi-task learning and transfer learning for natural language processing (NLP), few works have systematically studied the effect of scaling up the number of tasks during pre-training.

Using ExMix, we study the effect of multi-task pre-training at the largest scale to date, and analyze co-training transfer amongst common families of tasks. Through this analysis, we show that manually curating an ideal set of tasks for multi-task pre-training is not straightforward, and that multi-task scaling can vastly improve models on its own.

These models, however, also introduce new threats by possibly creating or promoting misinformation, either intentionally or deliberately by malicious users. In this thesis, we present novel methods to fight the proliferation of misinformation online. We focus on the task of automated fact verification where the veracity of a given claim is examined against external reliable sources. We analyze the desired specifications of fact verification systems and describe the need for efficiency when operating against large comprehensive free text information resources, while ensuring robustness to challenging inputs and sensitivity to modifications in the referenced evidence. Our methods are general and, as we demonstrate, improve the robustness, efficiency, and interpretability of many other models beyond fact verification. In the first part of this thesis, we focus on the robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability of sentence-pair classifiers. We present methodologies for identifying and quantifying idiosyncrasies in large curated datasets that undesirably lead models to rely on nongeneralizable statistical cues. We demonstrate how contrastive evidence pairs can alleviate this issue by enforcing models to perform sentence-pair inference. To obtain such examples automatically, we develop a novel rationale-based denoising pipeline for modifying refuting evidence to agree with a given claim. In addition, we present a semi-automated solution for creating contrastive pairs from Wikipedia revisions and share a new large dataset. In the second part, we turn to improve the inference efficiency of both the evidence retrieval and the claim classification modules, while reliably controlling their accuracy. We introduce new confidence measures and develop novel extensions to the conformal prediction framework.

The puzzles are objective in that each one is specified entirely by the source code of its verifier $f$, so evaluating $f$ is all that is needed to test a candidate solution.  They do not require an answer key or input/output examples, nor do they depend on natural language understanding.

We develop baseline enumerative program synthesis, GPT-3 and Codex solvers that are capable of solving puzzles---even without access to any reference solutions---by learning from their own past solutions. Codex performs best, solving up to 18% of 397 test problems with a single try and 80% of the problems with 1,000 tries per problem.

These approaches, broadly termed stylometry, have found success in source attribution and misinformation detection in human-written texts. However, in this work, we show that stylometry is limited against machine-generated misinformation. While humans speak differently when trying to deceive, LMs generate stylistically consistent text, regardless of underlying motive. Thus, though stylometry can successfully prevent impersonation by identifying text provenance, it fails to distinguish legitimate LM applications from those that introduce false information. We create two benchmarks demonstrating the stylistic similarity between malicious and legitimate uses of LMs, employed in auto-completion and editing-assistance settings. Our findings highlight the need for non-stylometry approaches in detecting machine-generated misinformation, and open up the discussion on the desired evaluation benchmarks.","tags":[""],"title":"The Limitations of Stylometry for Detecting Machine-Generated Fake News","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roei Schuster","Tal Schuster","Yoav Meri","Vitaly Shmatikov"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1579046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579046400,"objectID":"9eaafb21ed893968079607b179d0191e","permalink":"https://talschuster.github.io/publication/emb_attack/","publishdate":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/emb_attack/","section":"publication","summary":"Word embeddings, i.e., low-dimensional vector representations such as GloVe and SGNS, encode word \"meaning\" in the sense that distances between words' vectors correspond to their semantic proximity. This enables transfer learning of semantics for a variety of natural language processing tasks. Word embeddings are typically trained on large public corpora such as Wikipedia or Twitter. We demonstrate that an attacker who can modify the corpus on which the embedding is trained can control the \"meaning\" of new and existing words by changing their locations in the embedding space. We develop an explicit expression over corpus features that serves as a proxy for distance between words and establish a causative relationship between its values and embedding distances. We then show how to use this relationship for two adversarial objectives: (1) make a word a top-ranked neighbor of another word, and (2) move a word from one semantic cluster to another. An attack on the embedding can affect diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating for the first time the power of data poisoning in transfer learning scenarios. We use this attack to manipulate query expansion in information retrieval systems such as resume search, make certain names more or less visible to named entity recognition models, and cause new words to be translated to a particular target word regardless of the language. Finally, we show how the attacker can generate linguistically likely corpus modifications, thus fooling defenses that attempt to filter implausible sentences from the corpus using a language model.","tags":[""],"title":"Humpty Dumpty: Controlling Word Meanings via Corpus Poisoning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Darsh J Shah","Tal Schuster","Regina Barzilay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"5ea625ac32fa8a1ac46d4980fe1487eb","permalink":"https://talschuster.github.io/publication/fact_generation/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fact_generation/","section":"publication","summary":"Online encyclopediae like Wikipedia contain large amounts of text that need frequent corrections and updates. The new information may contradict existing content in encyclopediae. In this paper, we focus on rewriting such dynamically changing articles. This is a challenging constrained generation task, as the output must be consistent with the new information and fit into the rest of the existing document. To this end, we propose a two-step solution: (1) We identify and remove the contradicting components in a target text for a given claim, using a neutralizing stance model; (2) We expand the remaining text to be consistent with the given claim, using a novel two-encoder sequence-to-sequence model with copy attention. Applied to a Wikipedia fact update dataset, our method successfully generates updated sentences for new claims, achieving the highest SARI score. Furthermore, we demonstrate that generating synthetic data through such rewritten sentences can successfully augment the FEVER fact-checking training dataset, leading to a relative error reduction of 13%.","tags":[""],"title":"Automatic Fact-guided Sentence Modification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"478fb0dcfdddc34e1e4a4380dc95f197","permalink":"https://talschuster.github.io/project/conformal/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/conformal/","section":"project","summary":"Confidence-aware predictions","tags":["Vision","NLP","Deep Learning"],"title":"Conformal Prediction","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tal Schuster","Darsh J Shah","Yun Jie Serene Yeo","Daniel Filizzola","Enrico Santus","Regina Barzilay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565740800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565740800,"objectID":"6870585fdd769be814624a00c87dfb18","permalink":"https://talschuster.github.io/publication/fact_symmetric/","publishdate":"2019-08-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fact_symmetric/","section":"publication","summary":"Fact verification requires validating a claim in the context of evidence. We show, however, that in the popular FEVER dataset this might not necessarily be the case. Claim-only classifiers perform competitively with top evidence-aware models. In this paper, we investigate the cause of this phenomenon, identifying strong cues for predicting labels solely based on the claim, without considering any evidence. We create an evaluation set that avoids those idiosyncrasies. The performance of FEVER-trained models significantly drops when evaluated on this test set. Therefore, we introduce a regularization method which alleviates the effect of bias in the training data, obtaining improvements on the newly created test set. This work is a step towards a more sound evaluation of reasoning capabilities in fact verification models.","tags":[""],"title":"Towards Debiasing Fact Verification Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adam Yala","Tal Schuster","Randy Miles","Regina Barzilay","Constance Lehman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1565049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565049600,"objectID":"8a1f8e1a10a54491fee218ea25bc0648","permalink":"https://talschuster.github.io/publication/mammo_triage/","publishdate":"2019-08-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mammo_triage/","section":"publication","summary":"A DL model to triage a portion of mammograms as cancer free, improving performance and workflow efficiency.","tags":[""],"title":"A Deep Learning Model to Triage Screening Mammograms: A Simulation Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tal Schuster","Ori Ram","Regina Barzilay","Amir Globerson"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1559606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559606400,"objectID":"0a9ee1095508d67446f94b46c8842cdd","permalink":"https://talschuster.github.io/publication/crosslingual_embed/","publishdate":"2019-06-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/crosslingual_embed/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce a novel method for multilingual transfer that utilizes deep contextual embeddings, pretrained in an unsupervised fashion.

To this end, we construct context-independent variants of the original monolingual spaces and utilize their mapping to derive an alignment for the context-dependent spaces. This mapping readily supports processing of a target language, improving transfer by context-aware embeddings.

While radiologists are skilled in identifying suspicious areas once cancer is already visible on the image, they have limited capacity in predicting which patients are heading towards cancer diagnosis before mass is formed. Reliably identifying such patients is the crucial first step in preventing cancer development. Substantial research in medical literature confirms that certain changes in the breast tissue are early precursors of cancer development. However, patterns identified by humans are not sufficiently strong to act upon them.\nWe are aiming to automate these predictions by developing deep learning algorithms that can using longitudinal imaging data with known outcomes. By reading millions of images (orders of magnitude more than humans can read in their lifetime), machines should be able to assess the likelihood of cancer occurrence in a more accurate fashion. We are currently collecting a large corpus that will enable us to answer this question. Meanwhile, we are building algorithms that can help radiologists with their daily tasks of mammogram reading.
